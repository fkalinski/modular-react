## 1. Headless UI Libraries (Radix UI, Headless UI, Ark UI)

### What They Provide
- Unstyled, accessible UI primitives
- Compound component patterns
- Logic/state management without styling
- WAI-ARIA compliance

### What We Adopted
âœ… **Compound Component Pattern**: Using Context API to share state between sub-components
```typescript
<AppItemCard item={file}>
  <AppItemCard.Header />
  <AppItemCard.Body />
</AppItemCard>
```

âœ… **Headless Hooks**: Separating logic from presentation
```typescript
const { item, actions, executeAction } = useAppItem({ itemId });
```

âœ… **Slot-based Composition**: Named slots for flexible rendering
```typescript
<AppItemCard.Decorators slot="badge" />
```

### What We Extended
ðŸ”„ **Data Binding**: Headless UI libraries don't handle data fetching; we added adapters and query system

ðŸ”„ **Schema-Driven**: Added meta-model for defining entity types and their capabilities

ðŸ”„ **Extensibility**: Added action/decorator registration system beyond just component slots

### Key Differences
| Aspect | Headless UI | Our Architecture |
|--------|------------|------------------|
| Focus | UI Primitives (Dropdown, Dialog) | Domain Entities (AppItems) |
| Data | Bring Your Own | Integrated Adapters |
| Schema | No | Meta-Model Registry |
| Extensibility | Props + Children | Actions + Decorators + Aspects |

---

## 2. React Admin

### What They Provide
- Full-featured admin framework
- Resource-based architecture
- Data provider abstraction
- CRUD operations out-of-the-box

### What We Adopted
âœ… **Resource/Entity Abstraction**: Similar to their "resources," we have AppItem types

âœ… **Data Provider Pattern**: Our adapter pattern is similar to their data providers

âœ… **Action System**: Contextual actions based on entity state

### What We Did Differently
ðŸ”„ **No Framework Lock-in**: React Admin is an opinionated framework; ours is a library

ðŸ”„ **Aspect System**: We added composable aspects (sharing, governance) that React Admin doesn't have

ðŸ”„ **Perspective System**: Multiple views of same data (list, grid, timeline) vs React Admin's fixed views

ðŸ”„ **Module Federation**: Built for micro-frontends; React Admin is monolithic

### Key Differences
| Aspect | React Admin | Our Architecture |
|--------|------------|------------------|
| Approach | Opinionated Framework | Flexible Library |
| Components | Pre-styled | Headless + Styled Variants |
| Routing | Built-in Router | Bring Your Own |
| Auth | Built-in | Bring Your Own |
| Aspects | No | Yes (Sharing, Governance, etc.) |
| Federation | No | Yes |

**When to use React Admin**: Building a traditional admin panel with standard CRUD operations

**When to use our architecture**: Building a modular platform with domain-specific entities and cross-cutting concerns

---

## 3. Refine

### What They Provide
- Headless React framework for CRUD apps
- Data provider abstraction
- Hooks-first API
- Framework-agnostic (works with any UI library)

### What We Adopted
âœ… **Hooks-First Design**: Our `useAppItem` and `useAppItems` mirrors their approach

âœ… **Provider Pattern**: Data source registry similar to their data providers

âœ… **Separation of Concerns**: Logic separate from UI

### What We Extended
ðŸ”„ **Meta-Model**: Refine uses resource config; we added comprehensive meta-model with aspects

ðŸ”„ **View Perspectives**: Different ways to visualize same data

ðŸ”„ **Extensibility Points**: Actions, decorators, and aspects beyond Refine's capabilities

### Key Differences
| Aspect | Refine | Our Architecture |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| Focus | CRUD Operations | Domain Entities + Business Logic |
| Extensibility | Hooks + Providers | Hooks + Meta-Model + Aspects |
| Schema | Resource Config | Meta-Model Registry |
| Cross-Cutting Concerns | No | Yes (Aspects) |
| Perspectives | No | Yes |

**Similarity**: Both are headless and unopinionated about UI

**Difference**: Refine is CRUD-focused; we're domain-focused with Box-specific concerns

---

## 4. AG Grid (Enterprise Data Grids)

### What They Provide
- Powerful data grid with column definitions
- Cell renderers and formatters
- Filtering, sorting, pagination
- Master-detail relationships

### What We Adopted
âœ… **Column Definitions**: Similar to our field definitions in meta-model
```typescript
// AG Grid
{ field: 'size', valueFormatter: formatBytes }

// Our architecture
{ key: 'size', format: formatBytes }
```

âœ… **Cell Renderers**: Similar to our field render functions

âœ… **Master-Detail**: Similar to our related entities

### What We Extended
ðŸ”„ **Beyond Grids**: AG Grid is table-focused; we support multiple perspectives (list, grid, timeline)

ðŸ”„ **Actions**: Integrated action system vs AG Grid's context menu

ðŸ”„ **Aspects**: Cross-cutting concerns not present in AG Grid

### Key Differences
| Aspect | AG Grid | Our Architecture |
|--------|---------|------------------|
| UI Focus | Data Tables | Multiple Perspectives |
| Actions | Context Menus | Integrated Action System |
| Data Binding | Row Data | AppItem Entities |
| Extensibility | Column Defs | Meta-Model + Aspects |
| Views | Grid Only | List, Grid, Timeline, Custom |

**When to use AG Grid**: Need a powerful, enterprise-grade data table

**When to use our architecture**: Need flexible views of domain entities with business logic

## 5. Strapi / KeystoneJS (Headless CMS)

### What They Provide
- Schema-first content modeling
- Auto-generated APIs (REST/GraphQL)
- Plugin architecture
- Admin UI generation from schema

### What We Adopted
âœ… **Schema-Driven**: Meta-model defines structure like Strapi's content types

âœ… **Field Definitions**: Similar field configuration

âœ… **Plugin System**: Our action/decorator registration similar to Strapi plugins

### What We Did Differently
ðŸ”„ **Frontend-Focused**: Strapi is backend; we're frontend architecture

ðŸ”„ **React Components**: We provide reusable React components; Strapi generates admin UI

ðŸ”„ **No Backend**: We work with any backend (GraphQL, REST, snapshots)

### Key Differences
| Aspect | Strapi | Our Architecture |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| Layer | Backend + Admin UI | Frontend Only |
| Schema | Database Schema | Component Meta-Model |
| API | Generated | Bring Your Own |
| Components | Generated Admin UI | Reusable Component Library |
| Extensibility | Backend Plugins | Frontend Actions/Decorators |

**Similarity**: Both use schema/meta-model to drive UI generation

**Difference**: Strapi is full-stack CMS; we're frontend component architecture

---

## 6. Entity-Component-System (ECS) from Game Development

### What They Provide
- Composition over inheritance
- Entities are IDs with attached components
- Systems process entities with specific components
- Performance-optimized for thousands of entities

### What We Adopted
âœ… **Composition**: AppItems compose Aspects rather than inheriting

âœ… **Component Data**: Aspects are pure data (like ECS components)

âœ… **Query System**: Filter entities by aspects (like ECS queries)

### What We Adapted
ðŸ”„ **React-Friendly**: Traditional ECS uses arrays/typed arrays; we use Maps and objects

ðŸ”„ **Systems**: Instead of system loops, we have React components that render based on aspects

ðŸ”„ **Performance Trade-off**: ECS optimizes for 100k+ entities; we optimize for developer experience

### Comparison
| Aspect | Traditional ECS | Our Architecture |
|--------|----------------|------------------|
| Entities | Numeric IDs | AppItem objects |
| Components | Flat data in arrays | Aspects in Map |
| Systems | Update loops | React components |
| Performance | Ultra-high | React-typical |
| Queries | Bitmasking | Filter functions |

**Why not pure ECS**: React's reconciliation makes array-based ECS unnecessary; object-based is more ergonomic

- We integrate with Module Federation for micro-frontends

### ServiceNow (ITSM Platform)
**Similarities**:
- Table-driven (entity-driven) architecture
- Extensible through plugins
- UI policies and actions

**Differences**:
- ServiceNow is server-rendered; we're React SPA
- Different domain (ITSM vs content management)

---

## What Makes Our Architecture Unique

### 1. Aspect System
**Unique to our needs**: Box-specific concerns (sharing, governance, classification) as composable aspects

**Not found in**: Headless UI, React Admin, Refine, AG Grid

**Similar to**: ECS components, but React-optimized

### 2. Perspective System
**Unique capability**: Same data, multiple visualizations with different focus

**Not found in**: Most frameworks (they have fixed view types)

**Innovation**: Perspective is first-class citizen with query transforms and grouping

### 3. Meta-Model + Module Federation
**Unique combination**: Schema-driven components that work across federated modules

**Challenge solved**: Teams can independently develop entity types that compose together

**Not found in**: Any existing solution (Module Federation is new, 2020+)

### 4. Headless + Compound + Slots + Meta-Model
**Unique synthesis**: Combines four patterns that are usually separate

```typescript
// Headless
const { item, actions } = useAppItem({ itemId });

// Compound + Slots
<AppItemCard item={item}>
  <AppItemCard.Header>
    <CustomSlot /> {/* Slot injection */}
  </AppItemCard.Header>
</AppItemCard>

// Meta-Model driven
metaRegistry.register({
  type: 'file',
  actions: [...],
  decorators: [...]
});
```

**Result**: Maximum flexibility with minimum boilerplate
