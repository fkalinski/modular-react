# Vercel Deployment Status

## Current Status

Root Directories have been configured for all 8 projects ✅

However, the latest deployments (15 minutes ago) are showing errors.

## Check Deployment Status

Visit each project in Vercel Dashboard to see build logs:

| Project | Dashboard URL | Latest Deployment Status |
|---------|--------------|-------------------------|
| shared-components | https://vercel.com/fkalinskis-projects/shared-components | ● Error (15m ago) |
| shared-data | https://vercel.com/fkalinskis-projects/shared-data | ● Error (15m ago) |
| files-folders | https://vercel.com/fkalinskis-projects/files-folders | Check |
| hubs-tab | https://vercel.com/fkalinskis-projects/hubs-tab | Check |

## Likely Issues

### 1. Build Command Not Finding Turbo

The build command `cd ../.. && turbo run build:prod --filter=<package>` might be failing because:
- Turbo isn't installed at the root
- The `cd ../..` isn't working as expected

### 2. Missing Dependencies

The monorepo root might not have all dependencies installed.

## Next Steps

### Option A: Check Build Logs (Recommended)

1. Go to https://vercel.com/fkalinskis-projects/shared-components
2. Click on the latest deployment (the one with ● Error)
3. Check the "Building" tab to see the exact error
4. Share the error message

### Option B: Simplify Build Command

If Turbo isn't working, we can temporarily simplify the build command to test:

1. Change build command to just: `npm run build:prod`
2. But keep Root Directory set
3. This won't use Turbo's remote cache but should work

### Option C: Check Environment

Verify in Vercel Dashboard → Settings → General:
- **Root Directory**: Is it set correctly? (e.g., `shared-components`)
- **Build Command**: Does it match vercel.json?
- **Install Command**: Should be `npm install`
- **Node Version**: Should be 18.x or 20.x

## Commands to Debug

From your terminal:

```bash
# Check if turbo is in root package.json
cat package.json | grep turbo

# Check if vercel.json has correct settings
cat shared-components/vercel.json

# Try building locally with the same command
cd /Users/fkalinski/dev/fkalinski/modular-react/shared-components
cd ../..
turbo run build:prod --filter=@modular-platform/shared-components
```

## Expected Working URLs (When Fixed)

Once deployments succeed, you'll see URLs like:
- https://shared-components.vercel.app
- https://shared-data.vercel.app
- etc.

These are the URLs we'll need to configure in webpack configs for Module Federation.
