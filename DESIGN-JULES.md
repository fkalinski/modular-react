# Micro-frontend Architecture Design

## 1. Overall Architecture

The architecture will consist of a "Shell" application that provides the main navigation and orchestrates the loading of different micro-frontends. One of these micro-frontends will be the "Content" application, which, in turn, will act as a platform (a "sub-shell") for other, more specialized micro-frontends (e.g., "Files & Folders", "Hubs").

Here is a high-level representation of the architecture:

```
+---------------------------------------------------+
|                   Shell Application               |
| +-----------------------------------------------+ |
| |                  Navigation                   | |
| +-----------------------------------------------+ |
| |                                               | |
| |      +-----------------------------------+    | |
| |      |        Content Platform           |    | |
| |      | +-------------------------------+ |    | |
| |      | |        Shared Filters         | |    | |
| |      | +-------------------------------+ |    | |
| |      | |                               | |    | |
| |      | | +---------------------------+ | |    | |
| |      | | |      Files & Folders      | | |    | |
| |      | | |      (Micro-frontend)     | | |    | |
| |      | | +---------------------------+ | |    | |
| |      | |                               | |    | |
| |      | +-------------------------------+ |    | |
| |      |                                   |    | |
| |      +-----------------------------------+    | |
| |                                               | |
| +---------------------------------------------------+

## 2. Micro-frontend Technology: Webpack Module Federation

After careful consideration of your requirements and the current landscape of micro-frontend technologies, I recommend using **Webpack Module Federation**.

*   **Maturity and Stability:** Webpack Module Federation is a mature and widely adopted solution. It has a large community, extensive documentation, and a proven track record in production environments.
*   **Module Federation 2.0:** While Module Federation 2.0 (part of Webpack 6) promises improvements, it is still in its early stages. Sticking with the current, stable version of Module Federation (which works with Webpack 5) will be a safer and more reliable choice for your PoC. The migration path to version 2.0 in the future should be relatively smooth.
*   **Native Federation:** Native Federation is a very promising technology that leverages native browser features (ES Modules and Import Maps). However, it is still a relatively new and evolving technology. For your current needs, especially given the complexity of your project, Webpack Module Federation provides a more robust and feature-rich solution out of the box.

## 3. Communication Between Micro-frontends

To ensure that your components remain self-contained while allowing for necessary communication, I propose a combination of **React Context** and a lightweight **event bus**.

*   **React Context:** For parent-to-child communication (e.g., the "Content" platform passing filter values to its child tabs), we will use React Context. The "Content" platform will create a context provider, and the child micro-frontends will consume this context to access the shared data and callbacks.
*   **Event Bus:** For communication between micro-frontends that do not have a direct parent-child relationship, or for broadcasting application-wide events, we can use a simple, shared event bus library (like `tiny-emitter`). This will allow micro-frontends to publish and subscribe to events without being tightly coupled to each other.

## 4. Shared Components

For the PoC, we will create a shared component library within the "Content" monorepo. These components will be exposed via Webpack Module Federation, allowing other micro-frontends (like "Hubs") to consume them. We will use **semantic versioning** to manage the versions of these shared components, ensuring that breaking changes are handled explicitly.

## 5. Shared Data Sources (GraphQL)

We will create a shared library of GraphQL queries and mutations. Each micro-frontend will be able to import these base queries and extend them with their own domain-specific fields using GraphQL fragments. This will promote code reuse and consistency while maintaining the flexibility for each team to fetch the specific data they need.

## 6. Data-Driven UI

For the PoC, we will demonstrate the concept of a data-driven UI by using a simple JSON file to define the layout of a page. This JSON file will specify which components to render and in what order. A "renderer" component will then parse this JSON and dynamically render the appropriate components.

## 7. State Management (Redux)

Each micro-frontend will have its own, independent Redux store to manage its internal state. This will ensure that the components are truly self-contained and reusable. The shared data and communication between the micro-frontends will be handled through the mechanisms described in point 3 (React Context and Event Bus), not through a shared Redux store.
