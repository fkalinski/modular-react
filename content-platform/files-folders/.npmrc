# Configure npm registry for dependencies
# This allows Vercel to install @content-platform/tab-contract from your private registry

# For npm public registry (if you publish there):
# registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/

# For company Artifactory:
# registry=https://your-company.jfrog.io/artifactory/api/npm/npm-local/
# @content-platform:registry=https://your-company.jfrog.io/artifactory/api/npm/npm-local/
# //your-company.jfrog.io/artifactory/api/npm/npm-local/:_auth=${NPM_TOKEN}
# //your-company.jfrog.io/artifactory/api/npm/npm-local/:always-auth=true

# During development, this file can be empty (uses workspace dependencies)
# For Vercel deployment, uncomment and configure the registry above
