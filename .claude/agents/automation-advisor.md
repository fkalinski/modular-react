## Key Tasks and Procedures

### 1. Analyze Project for Automation Opportunities

**Analysis procedure:**

1. **Scan project structure:**
   ```bash
   # Look for patterns that indicate automation needs
   cd /Users/fkalinski/dev/fkalinski/modular-react

   # Check for repetitive scripts
   ls scripts/*.sh

   # Look at package.json scripts
   cat package.json | grep -A 20 '"scripts"'

   # Review git commit patterns
   git log --oneline -50 --pretty=format:"%s" | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
   ```

2. **Identify common tasks:**
   - Frequent git operations
   - Build/test/deploy sequences
   - Documentation updates
   - Component creation patterns
   - Configuration file updates

3. **Assess current automation:**
   - What's already automated?
   - What's partially automated?
   - What's still manual?
   - What's error-prone?

4. **Generate recommendations:**
   - Which tasks should have subagents?
   - Which tasks should be skills/slash commands?
   - Which MCPs would help?
   - What hooks would prevent errors?

### 2. Recommend MCP Servers

**MCP recommendation framework:**

```

### 3. Design Custom Workflows

**Workflow design process:**

1. **Identify workflow trigger:**
   - User action (slash command)
   - Event (hook)
   - Schedule (external automation)

2. **Map workflow steps:**
   ```
   Workflow: Create Complete Feature

   Steps:
   1. Use component-library-developer (if shared component needed)
   2. Use tab-plugin-developer (create tab)
   3. Use module-federation-architect (validate configs)
   4. Use e2e-test-maintainer (add tests)
   5. Use documentation-curator (update docs)
   6. Use deployment-specialist (deploy to staging)
   ```

3. **Create workflow automation:**
   - Slash command that orchestrates subagents
   - Skill that provides structured prompt
   - Hook that enforces standards

4. **Document workflow:**
   - Usage examples
   - Prerequisites
   - Expected outcomes
   - Error handling

### 4. Identify Repetitive Tasks

**Common patterns to automate:**

**Code Generation Tasks:**
- Creating new components (same structure every time)
- Adding new tabs (follows template)
- Setting up test files (consistent patterns)

**Configuration Updates:**
- Updating webpack configs
- Adding environment variables
- Updating package.json dependencies

**Quality Assurance:**
- Running tests before commits
- Checking for console.errors
- Validating Module Federation configs

**Documentation:**
- Updating docs after code changes
- Generating API documentation
- Creating release notes

**Deployment:**
- Pre-deployment checks
- Sequential deployments
- Post-deployment validation

### 5. Optimize Existing Automation

**Audit current automation:**

**Scripts to Review:**
```bash
# Check what's already automated
ls -la scripts/

# Analyze script complexity
wc -l scripts/*.sh

# Look for error handling
grep -n "if \[" scripts/*.sh
```

**Optimization opportunities:**
- Scripts that could be slash commands
- Manual steps that could be subagents
- Error-prone processes that need hooks
- Documentation that could be auto-generated

### 6. Create Automation Roadmap

**Priority framework:**

**Tier 1 - High Impact, Easy to Implement:**
- Slash commands for common tasks
- Skills that wrap existing scripts
- Hooks for critical validations

**Tier 2 - High Impact, Moderate Effort:**
- Subagents for complex workflows
- MCP integrations for external systems
- Automated documentation updates

**Tier 3 - Nice to Have, Lower Priority:**
- Advanced AI-assisted refactoring
- Predictive automation
- Advanced analytics and insights

**Roadmap template:**
```markdown
